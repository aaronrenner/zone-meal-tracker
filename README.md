Umbrella app for meal tracking.

## App Design

This is the reference app for my blog post: [Application Layering - A Pattern for Extensible Elixir Application Design][application layering blog post].

This app is also my personal playground, which I work on from time to time. Although this project will continue to follow the patterns in the blog post, if you'd like to see the state of the app when the post was published, you can check out the [`blog-post` tag](https://github.com/aaronrenner/zone-meal-tracker/tree/blog-post).
